            <description>A cranial implant that allows direct control of RobCo robots. RobCo Controllers are used by soldiers to control sentry bots, and by workers to control maintenance units. A person with a controller is known as a Mechanist.\n\Controllers are self-installable. Pressed into the back of the throat, the unit injects itself through the flesh to clamp inside the base of the skull where it meets the spinal cord. There, it threads a web of ultrafine wires throughout nearby neuronal tissue to make the direct mental link between the user and the robot receiver band.\n\Controllers are not simply devices for sending radio signals to robots, because robots are not merely machines. In addition to traditional computers, robots have a dim radition emission, so fluently controlling them requires a skilled controller. By linking Mechanist and robot both psychically and electromagnetically, the controller permits deeper control than screen-and-button interfaces.\n\nSince the controller interlaces deep within the brain tissue, it can only be removed after death.\n\nNote: A Mechanist must be capable of smithing work to construct robots.</description>
